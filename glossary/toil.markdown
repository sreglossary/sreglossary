# toil

**toil** is defined in various vocabularies as either a noun describing an *exhausting physical labor* or as a verb describing *working extremely hard or incessantly*.

In the context of **Site Reliability Engineering**, this term was defined at Google and is described in [Chapter 5 of the Google SRE Book](https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/eliminating-toil/). 

The definition is: ***Toil** is the kind of work tied to running a production service that tends to be **manual**, **repetitive**, ***automatable***, ***tactical***, ***devoid of enduring value***, and that ***scales linearly as a service grows***.*

While it is understood that not every task has to comply with all 6 of the properties listed above, the more similarities certain task has with these descriptions, the more likely it is a **toil**.

In general, the [Site Reliability Engineering book](https://landing.google.com/sre/books/) recommends reducing the amount of **toil** in the organization as a best practice.
