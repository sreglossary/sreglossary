# MTBF - Mean Time Between Failures

**MTBF** is a standard term for calculating the [mean / average](What%20is%20Statistical%20Mean?%20-%20Definition%20from%20Techopedia%20www.techopedia.com%20%E2%80%BA%20definition%20%E2%80%BA%20statistical-mean) time between failures of a certain system or component. 

Generally, **MTBF** is being used as an indicator for how reliable a certain system or component is or for comparing reliability of different components. 

In order to calculate **MTBF** one needs to take a certain time interval (for instance, 24 hours) and divide it for amount of incidents that happened in that interval. For example, if a system has failed twice during the 24 hours interval, its **MTBF**=24/2=12 hours.

Please note the sensitive distinction between **MTBF**, that is referring to a failure vs **MTBSI** (that stands for Mean Time Between Service Incidents). The difference is that in **MTBSI** calculation one also involves the time it takes to restore the service (on the average) - **MTRS** (Mean Time to Restore Service).

**MTBSI** = **MTBF** + **MTRS**
